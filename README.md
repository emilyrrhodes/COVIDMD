# COVIDMD

Goal: Run simulations to understand the mechanisms that allow for escape mutations using two different antibodies. (CC12.1 and CC12.3) 

1. Control (K417, Y421, D420) RBD
2. Control (K417, Y421, D420) Whole Spike
3. I358F - bottom left mutation in both
4. K417P – top in both; why so much better than all the others?
5. K417D – one of top mutations in 12-1 and bottom mutations in 12-3
6. K417N – polar are top for 12-1
7. K417I – apolar are top for 12-3
8. D420K – best for both
9. Y421H – best for both (with H NOT charged)
